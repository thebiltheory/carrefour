Time passed: 2 hours.

Tech Used: React;

How would I have done that?:
We barely have enough time in 2 hours to create something of quality but here are my potential improvements

- Usage of type language such as typescript to keep code quality and readability high
- Code splitting to lighten the loaded js bundle
- Seperate components into containers and presentational components.
- Add components snapshots and unit testing
- Serialize, transform api calls before consuming the payload.
- Seperate module components from shared component.
- I may have omit much more.

See you
